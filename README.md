# 🎤 Hip Hop Hangman

A stylish, browser-based **Hangman-style word game** celebrating **U.S. hip hop & rap artists** — built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

Players guess letters and numbers to reveal the name of a hip hop artist before they run out of lives. Misses trigger a vinyl **record scratch animation**, while wins and losses light up the graffiti logo with dynamic effects.
